Importing the function from the module:

Testing with a simple text:

    Hello.
    
    How are you?
    
    I'm fine:
    
    Thank you!

Testing with multiple spaces between sentences:
    >>> text_indentation("Hello.    How are you?    I'm fine:    Thank you!")
    Hello.
    
    How are you?
    
    I'm fine:

    Hello.
    
    How are you?
    
    I'm fine:
    
    Thank you!
