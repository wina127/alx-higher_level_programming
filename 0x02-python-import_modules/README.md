My Learning Journey: Python and Scripting
Throughout this study project, I am expected to grasp various aspects of Python programming, including fundamental concepts, scripting techniques, and best coding practices. Through a series of tasks, I ensure that I explore Python's features and its applications in diverse scenarios

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I am expected to achieve the following learning objectives:

Understanding why Python programming is widely regarded as an awe-inspiring skill.
Acquiring knowledge about the creator of Python and showing appreciation for Guido van Rossum's contributions.
Exploring the origins of the name 'Python' and its intriguing backstory.
Embracing the principles of the Zen of Python and recognizing their significance in crafting elegant code.
Making use of the Python interpreter to run and experiment with Python code.
Demonstrating proficiency in printing text and variables using the print function.
Gaining expertise in manipulating strings and mastering the concepts of indexing and slicing in Python.
Adhering to the official Python coding style and utilizing pycodestyle to validate my code.
Showcasing my ability to write and execute Python scripts for accomplishing various tasks.
Crafting concise and efficient shell scripts for different scenarios.
Compiling and executing C scripts with a strong focus on adhering to coding standards and optimizing efficiency.
Demonstrating my technical interview preparation skills by implementing singly linked list cycle detection in C.

Project Structure
This study project consists of multiple tasks, each contributing to my understanding and proficiency in Python programming and scripting. I will encounter the following tasks:

Run Python File: I ensure the creation of a Shell script that effectively runs a Python script using the $PYFILE environment variable.

Print Integer: Through this task, I will complete a source code to print an integer, followed by "Battery street" and a new line.

Hello, Print: I will write a Python script to accurately print a specific message using the print function.

Print Float: I will enhance source code to precisely print a float with a precision of 2 digits.

Print String: In this task, I will modify source code to print a string three times, followed by its first 9 characters.

Play with Strings: I will adapt the source code to effectively print a specific string with various manipulations.

Copy - Cut - Paste: Through this task, I will refactor the source code to manipulate and print specific parts of a string.

Create a New Sentence: I will modify source code to accurately print a predefined sentence using variables.

Easter Egg: I will craft a Python script to print "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters.

Linked List Cycle (Technical Interview Prep): In this task, I will implement a C function to detect cycles in a singly linked list, showcasing my technical interview preparation skills.

Requirements and Execution
Throughout this project, I ensure that I meet the specified requirements for each task, including adhering to specific language versions, maintaining the proper file structure, and following recommended code style. I execute the provided scripts and programs in accordance with the instructions provided for each task.
